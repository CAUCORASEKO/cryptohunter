Cryptocurrency search engine, tools for traders in the Binance futures market
This code is made in Python, it will help you find the currencies with the highest volatility and volume at the present time.

The code works with your personal Binance APIs, you have to give permissions to your APIs to read and trade in the Spot and futures market.

You have to store the APIs in a Secrets.py file

API_KEY ='Your API KEY goes here'

API_SECRET ='Your SECRET API goes here'

You can run the program in PyCharm, to avoid errors I do not recommend using the latest version of Python, nor do I recommend downloading the latest libraries.
